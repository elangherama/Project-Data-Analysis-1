# Project-Data-Analysis-1
This is my first practice project in data analysis. I used Excel for data processing and Looker Studio for visualization. This project focuses on transaction analysis to identify fraud patterns based on various factors such as latency and device type.

## Project Objective
- Analyze the number of transactions identified as fraud.
- Determine the total financial loss caused by fraudulent transactions.
- Identify the type of devices most commonly associated with fraudulent transactions.
- Examine the relationship between network latency and fraud occurrence.
